We currently support two types of built-in graders:

(1) Numeric Interval Graders

Example in NumericGrader directory.
Its a simple grader that expects a list of numbers from the learner, and grades/provides feedback by matching each number to a given set of intervals.

(2) Regular Expression Graders

Example in RegexGrader directory.
This grader expects a string from the learner as a submission, and grades/provides feedback based on which regular expression did the learner's submission match.
